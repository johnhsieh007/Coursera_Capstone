    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment I explore the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto. However, the neighborhood data though is not readily available on the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Toronto neighborhood data, a Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M exists that has all the information we need to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. We will have to scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas dataframe so that it is in a structured format.\n",
    "\n",
    "We build the code to scrape the following Wikipedia page, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M, in order to obtain the data that is in the table of postal codes and to transform the data into a pandas dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataframe will consist of three columns: PostalCode, Borough, and Neighborhood. We only process the cells that have an assigned borough. We ignore cells with a borough that is Not assigned. More than one neighborhood can exist in one postal code area. For example, in the table on the Wikipedia page, you will notice that M5A is listed twice and has two neighborhoods: Harbourfront and Regent Park. These two rows will be combined into one row with the neighborhoods separated with a comma. If a cell has a borough but a Not assigned neighborhood, then the neighborhood will be the same as the borough. So for the 9th cell in the table on the Wikipedia page, the value of the Borough and the Neighborhood columns will be Queen's Park.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different website scraping libraries and packages in Python. One of the most common packages is BeautifulSoup and we will use it in this project. Package's main documentation page: http://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get the data and start exploring it, let's download all the dependencies that we will need."
